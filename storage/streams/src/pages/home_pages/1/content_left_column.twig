<p><strong>The Crew:</strong></p>
<p>The Siskiyou Rappel Crew is a 21-person USFS initial attack crew based out of Grants Pass, OR. We have one national rappel aircraft and one national large fire support Type 1 aircraft,&nbsp;but routinely host additional helicopters on site as the season dictates that can be staffed as needed with the support of boosters and qualified district personnel. The crew consists of a Base Manager, Assistant Foreman, Squad Leaders, Senior Firefighters and temporary seasonal employees. We also have the ability to retain positions for detailers and Wildland Firefighter Apprentices to support the needs of the local units.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Job:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The crew's primary duty is to respond to incidents within Region 6 which encompasses Oregon and Washington. Initial Attack, logistical support, mapping, LEO flights, SAR missions, Medevac and prescribed fire duties are commonplace in addition to off-forest assignments for qualified personnel. The crew is very busy from late June to mid September while the helicopter is on contract, and personnel can supplement adjoining districts assisting in fire suppression and fuels projects to extend their duties later in the year.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Physical Fitness</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A great deal of emphasis is placed on physical fitness. It should go without saying that the work we perform is extremely physically demanding and requires a high level of physical conditioning. Applicants must pass the Work Capacity Test (WCT) at the arduous level consisting of a three mile pack carrying 45 pounds in 45 minutes or less. Failure to pass the WCT in the specified time will lead to dismissal.&nbsp; <br></p>
