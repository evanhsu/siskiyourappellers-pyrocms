<p>The first five weeks of the season, starting in early May, will be dedicated to extensive physical fitness, classroom, field training and the National Rappel Academy. This training will include mandatory annual training and refreshers, S-271 and Interagency Helicopter Training as well as becoming certified as a rookie rappeller. There is no down time during the training and trainees must demonstrate competency and proficiency in all aspects of the training or they will be removed from the program. During the course of the season, other training courses may be offered to further the qualifications and career development of each individual which will be outlined on an Individual Development Plan (IDP).<br></p><p>Only a small group of people are selected each year to become rappellers. It is a credit to those individuals to have been chosen for this position in terms of their abilities, character and proven performance. It is an opportunity that very few people get.<br></p>
